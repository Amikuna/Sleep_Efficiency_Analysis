# Sleep Efficiency Analysis
The Sleep Efficiency Analysis is a Python project that uses the Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries to analyze sleep efficiency data from a CSV file. The purpose of this project is to explore the data and find patterns that might be useful in improving sleep quality.

# Description
The project first reads in the CSV file, and then cleans the data by removing any missing values and duplicates. It also converts float numbers into integers where necessary. Once the data has been cleaned, the project uses various data visualization techniques to explore the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

he project answers several questions related to sleep quality, including:

* Do females sleep more efficiently than males?
* How does sleep efficiency vary with age?
* Does smoking have any effect on sleep quality?
* Does the amount of deep sleep have any effect on sleep efficiency?

The project uses bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize the data and help identify patterns and relationships.
